SFML GUI:

Use separate views for the "scene"/"level" and a UI overlay
Allows you to let the scene lock aspect ratio and scale UI

Creating a “clickable region” is the same as testing if a region’s been clicked.
  Can be made with a series of rectangular regions
  can just use sf::Rect and contains method: applies to both clicking and touch

Need to create visual feedback with something to be "clicked"
examples to use are sf::RectangleShape or sf::Sprite
